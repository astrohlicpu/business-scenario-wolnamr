Hi! I own a Girls High School. Until now we have been keeping a list of our students manually. This system has not been working efficently for us and we would like to
begin keeping electronic records. I need a roster with all the students basic information.
This includes: the student's first name, last name, address(including city,state and zip code),grade, class and favorite subject.
I would also like to see the amount of tuition received from this student and their remaining balance.

The name of the classes are:
Ninth grade: 9A, 9B, 9C
Tenth grade: 10A, 10B, 10C
Eleventh grade 11A, 11B, 11C
Twelveth grade 12A, 12B, 12C

QUESTIONS:
Q:How many classes do you have per grade?
A: 3

Q:How much does tuition cost?
A: $15,000

Q: Do you have any relatives in your school? two girls with the same last name? 
A: not too many but, yes

Reports:
1) Show me the number of students per zip code
2) Show me a list of students who have already sent in the full tuition
3) Show me a list of girls who have at least one sister in school with them
4) Show me the most popular favorite subject
5) Show me a list of all students in the following format: Last name:First Name-grade(favorit subject)
